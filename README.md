3D  .stl file  rendered by both Github and by Meshlab. So far only mono-colour working. 
To render by Meshlab may require cloning the whole repository to get the single file.
(At least, I have not found how to download a single file that Github wants to render.)

3D  .atl file  rendered by Github? (very big file) but not by Meshlab. So far only mono-colour. 
There seems to be no advantage over a .stl file.

3D  .wrl file (opens with eg. Meshlab) but may need file download and then view. Good, full colour. 
Not rendered by github.
