- put ssd header to I2C2.

- MCU on board?

- LoRa on board?

- BOM

- The mounting hole centers are 44mm apart in x direction and 66.9 mm in y direction.
  (This is adjusted very slightly and squared from project ads1115with16JTS.)


- AHT10 sensor module reference  https://www.electroschematics.com/temperature-sensor/

- Reset pullup to PA8 on header,  "Reset" marked on Silksreen, but beware stm32g4xx uses  PB7 
  Reset is held low by opendrain to reset. For normal operation reset is at vcc through pullup resistor.

See  http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/SLVA689 re pullup sensor size.  !! very good

pullup 10k vs 20k? vs 4.7k?  Consider pullup on sensor so small resister can be used with long wires and
power is not lost when there is no sensor.

4.7k seems to be needed sometimes on short wires, while 10k sometimes works on long wires.
Possibly poor connections on RJ11 or on AHT10 module boards.
Should use 4.7k to help insur better signal. Additional power should be small.
In case of still bad signal: additional resistors can be added can be added in the J1 .. J8 connectors
from power to SC and to SD, beside wires to the sensor module.

datasheet
https://www.ti.com/document-viewer/TCA9548A/datasheet#device-address-scps2079628/SCPS2079628

Fixed address:

- The default only address could be specified by wiring A0, A1, A2 to GND.

- Other address could be specifed with GND and VCC wired settings.

Changeable address:

- a jumper block is possible but error prone. The jumper has to go to either GND or VCC, which is 
possibly error prone. (A missing jumper would cause floating.)

- Solder pads for 0 ohm resistors (or solder bridges) can be setup to change GND and VCC settings.
This requires a solder iron and is not easily changed "in the field". Not clear that is needed.

- A DIP style switch can be used. The need for either GND or VCC means a pull-up or pull-down resistor
is needed for each address pin A:

 The usual. Switch X open pulls A high through R to VCC. X closed pulls A low to GND. 
              A    --- R --- VCC
                    |
                    X ---- GND

 The alternate. Switch X open pulls A low through R to GND. X closed pulls A high to VCC.
                  A   --- X ---  VCC
                       |
                       --- R --- GND

 In either case one address setting causes a power loss from Vcc through R to ground.
 With VCC=3.2v and R = 100 K ohms The current is 0.032 mA and the power loss 0.01 mW per address.
 According to the datasheet section 6.5 the current flow through A is max 0.001 mA when there is a direct 
 connection to GND or VCC. 
 This flow is even in the case the MCU and  PCA9548 are in sleep mode. 
 That is not attractive for battery or solar opperation so the resistor R should be as large
 as possible but still achieve necesssary high/low voltage. 
 
 From the datasheet section 6.3 high should be at least 0.7 x Vcc and low should be less than 0.3 x Vcc.
 So with Vcc 3.2v  high is at least 2.24v and low is less than 0.96v.
 The necessary check in the alternate configuration is that with X open the drop from A to GND is 
 less than 0.96v. At max current 0.001 mA the voltage drop through a 100 K ohm resistor is 0.1v.
 Thus an even large resistance would be possible.

 The alternate configuration is used so there is no power loss through R in the most usual 
 setting  -  all address 0. X open and A pulled low to ground through R. In less usual situations where 
 some address pins are high the power supply will likely need to be more robust for other reasons too.
